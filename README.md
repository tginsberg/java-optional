# java.util.Optional

This is lightning talk I gave at a Chicago Java Users Group meeting on June 2, 2016. This was my second time speaking in public, and I feel like I learned a lot since [my talk on Akka](https://github.com/tginsberg/what-is-akka).

### Slide Show

This slides for this presentation can be [viewed here](https://tginsberg.github.io/java-optional).

### Feedback

This time, I included a link to a quick anonymous survey in order to collect feedback. Two people in the audience were kind enough to spend time filling it out and I got some great feedback. Things I have to work on: don't use the podium as a shield, and don't look down so much. Things to work on for next time, for sure.
